  abstract={Compared to joint position, the accuracy of joint rotation and shapeestimation has received relatively little attention in the skinned multi-personlinear model (SMPL)-based human mesh reconstruction from multi-view images. Thework in this field is broadly classified into two categories. The firstapproach performs joint estimation and then produces SMPL parameters by fittingSMPL to resultant joints. The second approach regresses SMPL parametersdirectly from the input images through a convolutional neural network(CNN)-based model. However, these approaches suffer from the lack ofinformation for resolving the ambiguity of joint rotation and shapereconstruction and the difficulty of network learning. To solve theaforementioned problems, we propose a two-stage method. The proposed methodfirst estimates the coordinates of mesh vertices through a CNN-based model frominput images, and acquires SMPL parameters by fitting the SMPL model to theestimated vertices. Estimated mesh vertices provide sufficient information fordetermining joint rotation and shape, and are easier to learn than SMPLparameters. According to experiments using Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets,the proposed method significantly outperforms the previous works in terms ofjoint rotation and shape estimation, and achieves competitive performance interms of joint location estimation.},

The first (baseline) solution is a basic differentiablealgebraic triangulation with an addition of confidence weights estimated fromthe input images. The second solution is based on a novel method of volumetricaggregation from intermediate 2D backbone feature maps. The aggregated volumeis then refined via 3D convolutions that produce final 3D joint heatmaps andallow modelling a human pose prior. Crucially, both approaches are end-to-enddifferentiable, which allows us to directly optimize the target metric. Wedemonstrate transferability of the solutions across datasets and considerablyimprove the multi-view state of the art on the Human3.6M dataset.

  abstract={Supervised approaches to 3D pose estimation from single images are remarkablyeffective when labeled data is abundant. However, as the acquisition ofground-truth 3D labels is labor intensive and time consuming, recent attentionhas shifted towards semi- and weakly-supervised learning. Generating aneffective form of supervision with little annotations still poses majorchallenge in crowded scenes. In this paper we propose to impose multi-viewgeometrical constraints by means of a weighted differentiable triangulation anduse it as a form of self-supervision when no labels are available. We thereforetrain a 2D pose estimator in such a way that its predictions correspond to there-projection of the triangulated 3D pose and train an auxiliary network onthem to produce the final 3D poses. We complement the triangulation with aweighting mechanism that alleviates the impact of noisy predictions caused byself-occlusion or occlusion from other subjects. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of our semi-supervised approach on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHPdatasets, as well as on a new multi-view multi-person dataset that featuresocclusion.},

  abstract={Recently, the vision transformer and its variants have played an increasinglyimportant role in both monocular and multi-view human pose estimation.Considering image patches as tokens, transformers can model the globaldependencies within the entire image or across images from other views.However, global attention is computationally expensive. As a consequence, it isdifficult to scale up these transformer-based methods to high-resolutionfeatures and many views.  In this paper, we propose the token-Pruned Pose Transformer (PPT) for 2Dhuman pose estimation, which can locate a rough human mask and performsself-attention only within selected tokens. Furthermore, we extend our PPT tomulti-view human pose estimation. Built upon PPT, we propose a new cross-viewfusion strategy, called human area fusion, which considers all human foregroundpixels as corresponding candidates. Experimental results on COCO and MPIIdemonstrate that our PPT can match the accuracy of previous pose transformermethods while reducing the computation. Moreover, experiments on Human 3.6M andSki-Pose demonstrate that our Multi-view PPT can efficiently fuse cues frommultiple views and achieve new state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract={This paper presents Volumetric Transformer Pose estimator (VTP), the first 3Dvolumetric transformer framework for multi-view multi-person 3D human poseestimation. VTP aggregates features from 2D keypoints in all camera views anddirectly learns the spatial relationships in the 3D voxel space in anend-to-end fashion. The aggregated 3D features are passed through 3Dconvolutions before being flattened into sequential embeddings and fed into atransformer. A residual structure is designed to further improve theperformance. In addition, the sparse Sinkhorn attention is empowered to reducethe memory cost, which is a major bottleneck for volumetric representations,while also achieving excellent performance. The output of the transformer isagain concatenated with 3D convolutional features by a residual design. Theproposed VTP framework integrates the high performance of the transformer withvolumetric representations, which can be used as a good alternative to theconvolutional backbones. Experiments on the Shelf, Campus and CMU Panopticbenchmarks show promising results in terms of both Mean Per Joint PositionError (MPJPE) and Percentage of Correctly estimated Parts (PCP).

  abstract={We present Multi-view Pose transformer (MvP) for estimating multi-person 3Dposes from multi-view images. Instead of estimating 3D joint locations fromcostly volumetric representation or reconstructing the per-person 3D pose frommultiple detected 2D poses as in previous methods, MvP directly regresses themulti-person 3D poses in a clean and efficient way, without relying onintermediate tasks. Specifically, MvP represents skeleton joints as learnablequery embeddings and let them progressively attend to and reason over themulti-view information from the input images to directly regress the actual 3Djoint locations. To improve the accuracy of such a simple pipeline, MvPpresents a hierarchical scheme to concisely represent query embeddings ofmulti-person skeleton joints and introduces an input-dependent query adaptationapproach. Further, MvP designs a novel geometrically guided attentionmechanism, called projective attention, to more precisely fuse the cross-viewinformation for each joint. MvP also introduces a RayConv operation tointegrate the view-dependent camera geometry into the feature representationsfor augmenting the projective attention. We show experimentally that our MvPmodel outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks whilebeing much more efficient. Notably, it achieves 92.3% AP25 on the challengingPanoptic dataset, improving upon the previous best approach [36] by 9.8%. MvPis general and also extendable to recovering human mesh represented by the SMPLmodel, thus useful for modeling multi-person body shapes.

Feature Extractor estimates 2D pose fromeach image and fuses the prediction according to the confidence.

It adaptively measures the implicit relativerelationship between each pair of views and reconstructs more informativefeatures. TFT aggregates the features of the whole sequence and predicts 3Dpose via a transformer. It adaptively deals with the video of arbitrary lengthand fully unitizes the temporal information.

We capitalize on constraintsoffered by the 3D geometry of the camera setup and the 3D structure of thehuman body to probabilistically combine per view 2D ConvNet predictions into aglobally optimal 3D pose. This 3D pose is used as the basis for harvestingannotations. The benefit of the annotations produced automatically with ourapproach is demonstrated in two challenging settings: (i) fine-tuning a genericConvNet-based 2D pose predictor to capture the discriminative aspects of asubject's appearance (i.e.,"personalization"), and (ii) training a ConvNet fromscratch for single view 3D human pose prediction without leveraging 3D posegroundtruth.

  abstract={Heatmap regression has become the most prevalent choice for nowadays humanpose estimation methods. The ground-truth heatmaps are usually constructed viacovering all skeletal keypoints by 2D gaussian kernels. The standard deviationsof these kernels are fixed. However, for bottom-up methods, which need tohandle a large variance of human scales and labeling ambiguities, the currentpractice seems unreasonable. To better cope with these problems, we propose thescale-adaptive heatmap regression (SAHR) method, which can adaptively adjustthe standard deviation for each keypoint. In this way, SAHR is more tolerant ofvarious human scales and labeling ambiguities. However, SAHR may aggravate theimbalance between fore-background samples, which potentially hurts theimprovement of SAHR. Thus, we further introduce the weight-adaptive heatmapregression (WAHR) to help balance the fore-background samples. Extensiveexperiments show that SAHR together with WAHR largely improves the accuracy ofbottom-up human pose estimation. As a result, we finally outperform thestate-of-the-art model by +1.5AP and achieve 72.0AP on COCO test-dev2017, whichis com-arable with the performances of most top-down methods.

  abstract={This paper presents a new end-to-end semi-supervised framework to learn adense keypoint detector using unlabeled multiview images. A key challenge liesin finding the exact correspondences between the dense keypoints in multipleviews since the inverse of keypoint mapping can be neither analytically derivednor differentiated. This limits applying existing multiview supervisionapproaches on sparse keypoint detection that rely on the exact correspondences.To address this challenge, we derive a new probabilistic epipolar constraintthat encodes the two desired properties. (1) Soft correspondence: we define amatchability, which measures a likelihood of a point matching to the otherimage's corresponding point, thus relaxing the exact correspondences'requirement. (2) Geometric consistency: every point in the continuouscorrespondence fields must satisfy the multiview consistency collectively. Weformulate a probabilistic epipolar constraint using a weighted average ofepipolar errors through the matchability thereby generalizing thepoint-to-point geometric error to the field-to-field geometric error. Thisgeneralization facilitates learning a geometrically coherent dense keypointdetection model by utilizing a large number of unlabeled multiview images.Additionally, to prevent degenerative cases, we employ a distillation-basedregularization by using a pretrained model. Finally, we design a new neuralnetwork architecture, made of twin networks, that effectively minimizes theprobabilistic epipolar errors of all possible correspondences between two viewimages by building affinity matrices. Our method shows superior performancecompared to existing methods, including non-differentiable bootstrapping interms of keypoint accuracy, multiview consistency, and 3D reconstructionaccuracy.},

Despite their wide use, we show that existingmodels of the head and hands fail to capture the full range of motion for theseparts. Moreover, existing work largely ignores the feet, which are crucial formodeling human movement and have applications in biomechanics, animation, andthe footwear industry. The problem is that previous body part models aretrained using 3D scans that are isolated to the individual parts. Such datadoes not capture the full range of motion for such parts, e.g. the motion ofhead relative to the neck. Our observation is that full-body scans provideimportant information about the motion of the body parts. Consequently, wepropose a new learning scheme that jointly trains a full-body model andspecific part models using a federated dataset of full-body and body-partscans. Specifically, we train an expressive human body model called SUPR(Sparse Unified Part-Based Human Representation), where each joint strictlyinfluences a sparse set of model vertices. The factorized representationenables separating SUPR into an entire suite of body part models. Note that thefeet have received little attention and existing 3D body models have highlyunder-actuated feet. Using novel 4D scans of feet, we train a model with anextended kinematic tree that captures the range of motion of the toes.Additionally, feet deform due to ground contact. To model this, we include anovel non-linear deformation function that predicts foot deformationconditioned on the foot pose, shape, and ground contact. We train SUPR on anunprecedented number of scans: 1.2 million body, head, hand and foot scans.

  abstract={In this paper we present a high fidelity and articulated 3D human foot model.The model is parameterised by a disentangled latent code in terms of shape,texture and articulated pose. While high fidelity models are typically createdwith strong supervision such as 3D keypoint correspondences orpre-registration, we focus on the difficult case of little to no annotation. Tothis end, we make the following contributions: (i) we develop a Foot ImplicitNeural Deformation field model, named FIND, capable of tailoring explicitmeshes at any resolution i.e. for low or high powered devices; (ii) an approachfor training our model in various modes of weak supervision with progressivelybetter disentanglement as more labels, such as pose categories, are provided;(iii) a novel unsupervised part-based loss for fitting our model to 2D imageswhich is better than traditional photometric or silhouette losses; (iv)finally, we release a new dataset of high resolution 3D human foot scans,Foot3D. On this dataset, we show our model outperforms a strong PCAimplementation trained on the same data in terms of shape quality and partcorrespondences, and that our novel unsupervised part-based loss improvesinference on images.},

  abstract={Photo-real digital human avatars are of enormous importance in graphics, asthey enable immersive communication over the globe, improve gaming andentertainment experiences, and can be particularly beneficial for AR and VRsettings. However, current avatar generation approaches either fall short inhigh-fidelity novel view synthesis, generalization to novel motions,reproduction of loose clothing, or they cannot render characters at the highresolution offered by modern displays. To this end, we propose HDHumans, whichis the first method for HD human character synthesis that jointly produces anaccurate and temporally coherent 3D deforming surface and highlyphoto-realistic images of arbitrary novel views and of motions not seen attraining time. At the technical core, our method tightly integrates a classicaldeforming character template with neural radiance fields (NeRF). Our method iscarefully designed to achieve a synergy between classical surface deformationand NeRF. First, the template guides the NeRF, which allows synthesizing novelviews of a highly dynamic and articulated character and even enables thesynthesis of novel motions. Second, we also leverage the dense pointcloudsresulting from NeRF to further improve the deforming surface via 3D-to-3Dsupervision. We outperform the state of the art quantitatively andqualitatively in terms of synthesis quality and resolution, as well as thequality of 3D surface reconstruction.},

To increase the size of thisdataset to a scale compatible with typical data hungry learning algorithms, wepropose an elaborate captioning process that generates automatic syntheticdescriptions in natural language from given 3D keypoints. This process extractslow-level pose information -- the posecodes -- using a set of simple butgeneric rules on the 3D keypoints. The posecodes are then combined into higherlevel textual descriptions using syntactic rules. Automatic annotationssubstantially increase the amount of available data, and make it possible toeffectively pretrain deep models for finetuning on human captions.

  abstract={Combining human body models with differentiable rendering has recentlyenabled animatable avatars of clothed humans from sparse sets of multi-view RGBvideos. While state-of-the-art approaches achieve realistic appearance withneural radiance fields (NeRF), the inferred geometry often lacks detail due tomissing geometric constraints. Further, animating avatars inout-of-distribution poses is not yet possible because the mapping fromobservation space to canonical space does not generalize faithfully to unseenposes. In this work, we address these shortcomings and propose a model tocreate animatable clothed human avatars with detailed geometry that generalizewell to out-of-distribution poses. To achieve detailed geometry, we combine anarticulated implicit surface representation with volume rendering. Forgeneralization, we propose a novel joint root-finding algorithm forsimultaneous ray-surface intersection search and correspondence search. Ouralgorithm enables efficient point sampling and accurate point canonicalizationwhile generalizing well to unseen poses. We demonstrate that our proposedpipeline can generate clothed avatars with high-quality pose-dependent geometryand appearance from a sparse set of multi-view RGB videos.

ABS is based on the skinned multiperson linear (SMPL)body model, and aims to maximize BMnet measurement prediction error withrespect to latent SMPL shape parameters. ABS is fully differentiable withrespect to these parameters, and trained end-to-end via backpropagation withBMnet in the loop. Experiments show that ABS effectively discovers adversarialexamples, such as bodies with extreme body mass indices (BMI), consistent withthe rarity of extreme-BMI bodies in BMnet's training set. Thus ABS is able toreveal gaps in training data and potential failures in predictingunder-represented body shapes. Results show that training BMnet with ABSimproves measurement prediction accuracy on real bodies by up to 10%, whencompared to no augmentation or random body shape sampling. Furthermore, ourmethod significantly outperforms SOTA measurement estimation methods by as muchas 3x.

  abstract={Multi-person pose estimation generally follows top-down and bottom-upparadigms. Both of them use an extra stage ($\boldsymbol{e.g.,}$ humandetection in top-down paradigm or grouping process in bottom-up paradigm) tobuild the relationship between the human instance and corresponding keypoints,thus leading to the high computation cost and redundant two-stage pipeline. Toaddress the above issue, we propose to represent the human parts as adaptivepoints and introduce a fine-grained body representation method. The novel bodyrepresentation is able to sufficiently encode the diverse pose information andeffectively model the relationship between the human instance and correspondingkeypoints in a single-forward pass. With the proposed body representation, wefurther deliver a compact single-stage multi-person pose regression network,termed as AdaptivePose. During inference, our proposed network only needs asingle-step decode operation to form the multi-person pose without complexpost-processes and refinements. We employ AdaptivePose for both 2D/3Dmulti-person pose estimation tasks to verify the effectiveness of AdaptivePose.Without any bells and whistles, we achieve the most competitive performance onMS COCO and CrowdPose in terms of accuracy and speed. Furthermore, theoutstanding performance on MuCo-3DHP and MuPoTS-3D further demonstrates theeffectiveness and generalizability on 3D scenes.

  abstract={In this paper, we tackle the task of scene-aware 3D human motion forecasting,which consists of predicting future human poses given a 3D scene and a pasthuman motion. A key challenge of this task is to ensure consistency between thehuman and the scene, accounting for human-scene interactions. Previous attemptsto do so model such interactions only implicitly, and thus tend to produceartifacts such as "ghost motion" because of the lack of explicit constraintsbetween the local poses and the global motion. Here, by contrast, we propose toexplicitly model the human-scene contacts. To this end, we introducedistance-based contact maps that capture the contact relationships betweenevery joint and every 3D scene point at each time instant. We then develop atwo-stage pipeline that first predicts the future contact maps from the pastones and the scene point cloud, and then forecasts the future human poses byconditioning them on the predicted contact maps. During training, we explicitlyencourage consistency between the global motion and the local poses via a priordefined using the contact maps and future poses.

Different from them, our STR aims tolearn accurate and natural motion sequences in an unconstrained environmentthrough temporal and spatial tendency and to fully excavate the spatio-temporalfeatures of existing video data. To this end, our STR learns the representationof features in the temporal and spatial dimensions respectively, to concentrateon a more robust representation of spatio-temporal features. More specifically,for efficient temporal modeling, we first propose a temporal tendency reasoning(TTR) module. TTR constructs a time-dimensional hierarchical residualconnection representation within a video sequence to effectively reasontemporal sequences' tendencies and retain effective dissemination of humaninformation. Meanwhile, for enhancing the spatial representation, we design aspatial tendency enhancing (STE) module to further learns to excite spatiallytime-frequency domain sensitive features in human motion informationrepresentations. Finally, we introduce integration strategies to integrate andrefine the spatio-temporal feature representations.

  abstract={While recent work has shown progress on extracting clothed 3D human avatarsfrom a single image, video, or a set of 3D scans, several limitations remain.Most methods use a holistic representation to jointly model the body andclothing, which means that the clothing and body cannot be separated forapplications like virtual try-on. Other methods separately model the body andclothing, but they require training from a large set of 3D clothed human meshesobtained from 3D/4D scanners or physics simulations. Our insight is that thebody and clothing have different modeling requirements. While the body is wellrepresented by a mesh-based parametric 3D model, implicit representations andneural radiance fields are better suited to capturing the large variety inshape and appearance present in clothing. Building on this insight, we proposeSCARF (Segmented Clothed Avatar Radiance Field), a hybrid model combining amesh-based body with a neural radiance field. Integrating the mesh into thevolumetric rendering in combination with a differentiable rasterizer enables usto optimize SCARF directly from monocular videos, without any 3D supervision.The hybrid modeling enables SCARF to (i) animate the clothed body avatar bychanging body poses (including hand articulation and facial expressions), (ii)synthesize novel views of the avatar, and (iii) transfer clothing betweenavatars in virtual try-on applications. We demonstrate that SCARF reconstructsclothing with higher visual quality than existing methods, that the clothingdeforms with changing body pose and body shape, and that clothing can besuccessfully transferred between avatars of different subjects.

In particular, we present a novel\textbf{M}ulti-view human body \textbf{M}esh \textbf{T}ranslator (MMT) modelfor estimating human body mesh with the help of vision transformer.Specifically, MMT takes multi-view images as input and translates them totargeted meshes in a single-forward manner. MMT fuses features of differentviews in both encoding and decoding phases, leading to representations embeddedwith global information. Additionally, to ensure the tokens are intensivelyfocused on the human pose and shape, MMT conducts cross-view alignment at thefeature level by projecting 3D keypoint positions to each view and enforcingtheir consistency in geometry constraints. Comprehensive experimentsdemonstrate that MMT outperforms existing single or multi-view models by alarge margin for human mesh recovery task, notably, 28.8\% improvement in MPVEover the current state-of-the-art method on the challenging HUMBI dataset.Qualitative evaluation also verifies the effectiveness of MMT in reconstructinghigh-quality human mesh.

Existing methods either need calibrated cameras or calibratethem relative to a static camera, which acts as the reference frame for themocap system. The calibration step has to be done a priori for every capturesession, which is a tedious process, and re-calibration is required whenevercameras are intentionally or accidentally moved. In this paper, we propose amocap method which uses multiple static and moving extrinsically uncalibratedRGB cameras. The key components of our method are as follows. First, since thecameras and the subject can move freely, we select the ground plane as a commonreference to represent both the body and the camera motions unlike existingmethods which represent bodies in the camera coordinate. Second, we learn aprobability distribution of short human motion sequences ($\sim$1sec) relativeto the ground plane and leverage it to disambiguate between the camera andhuman motion. Third, we use this distribution as a motion prior in a novelmulti-stage optimization approach to fit the SMPL human body model and thecamera poses to the human body keypoints on the images.

To achieve this, weleverage recent advances in dense monocular SLAM and real-time hierarchicalvolumetric neural radiance fields. Our insight is that dense monocular SLAMprovides the right information to fit a neural radiance field of the scene inreal-time, by providing accurate pose estimates and depth-maps with associateduncertainty. With our proposed uncertainty-based depth loss, we achieve notonly good photometric accuracy, but also great geometric accuracy. In fact, ourproposed pipeline achieves better geometric and photometric accuracy thancompeting approaches (up to 179% better PSNR and 86% better L1 depth), whileworking in real-time and using only monocular images.},

  abstract={Estimating 3D poses and shapes in the form of meshes from monocular RGBimages is challenging. Obviously, it is more difficult than estimating 3D posesonly in the form of skeletons or heatmaps. When interacting persons areinvolved, the 3D mesh reconstruction becomes more challenging due to theambiguity introduced by person-to-person occlusions. To tackle the challenges,we propose a coarse-to-fine pipeline that benefits from 1) inverse kinematicsfrom the occlusion-robust 3D skeleton estimation and 2) Transformer-basedrelation-aware refinement techniques. In our pipeline, we first obtainocclusion-robust 3D skeletons for multiple persons from an RGB image. Then, weapply inverse kinematics to convert the estimated skeletons to deformable 3Dmesh parameters. Finally, we apply the Transformer-based mesh refinement thatrefines the obtained mesh parameters considering intra- and inter-personrelations of 3D meshes. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate theeffectiveness of our method, outperforming state-of-the-arts on 3DPW, MuPoTSand AGORA datasets.},

  abstract={Statistical 3D shape models of the head, hands, and fullbody are widely usedin computer vision and graphics. Despite their wide use, we show that existingmodels of the head and hands fail to capture the full range of motion for theseparts. Moreover, existing work largely ignores the feet, which are crucial formodeling human movement and have applications in biomechanics, animation, andthe footwear industry. The problem is that previous body part models aretrained using 3D scans that are isolated to the individual parts. Such datadoes not capture the full range of motion for such parts, e.g. the motion ofhead relative to the neck. Our observation is that full-body scans provideimportant information about the motion of the body parts. Consequently, wepropose a new learning scheme that jointly trains a full-body model andspecific part models using a federated dataset of full-body and body-partscans. Specifically, we train an expressive human body model called SUPR(Sparse Unified Part-Based Human Representation), where each joint strictlyinfluences a sparse set of model vertices. The factorized representationenables separating SUPR into an entire suite of body part models. Note that thefeet have received little attention and existing 3D body models have highlyunder-actuated feet. Using novel 4D scans of feet, we train a model with anextended kinematic tree that captures the range of motion of the toes.Additionally, feet deform due to ground contact. To model this, we include anovel non-linear deformation function that predicts foot deformationconditioned on the foot pose, shape, and ground contact. We train SUPR on anunprecedented number of scans: 1.2 million body, head, hand and foot scans. Wequantitatively compare SUPR and the separated body parts and find that oursuite of models generalizes better than existing models. SUPR is available athttp://supr.is.tue.mpg.de},

Our policies are trained to adapt to awide range of conditions in simulation.

Compared to NeRF-based rendering which suffers from densespatial sampling, point clouds rendering is naturally less computationintensive, which enables its deployment in mobile computing device. In thiswork, we focus on boosting the image quality of point clouds rendering with acompact model design. We first analyze the adaption of the volume renderingformulation on point clouds. Based on the analysis, we simplify the NeRFrepresentation to a spatial mapping function which only requires singleevaluation per pixel. Further, motivated by ray marching, we rectify the thenoisy raw point clouds to the estimated intersection between rays and surfacesas queried coordinates, which could avoid spatial frequency collapse andneighbor point disturbance. Composed of rasterization, spatial mapping and therefinement stages, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance onpoint clouds rendering, outperforming prior works by notable margins, with asmaller model size. We obtain a PSNR of 31.74 on NeRF-Synthetic, 25.88 onScanNet and 30.81 on DTU. Code and data would be released soon.},

First, we propose to decompose the 4Dspatiotemporal space according to temporal characteristics. Points in the 4Dspace are associated with probabilities of belonging to three categories:static, deforming, and new areas. Each area is represented and regularized by aseparate neural field.

Ourapproach, coined NeRFPlayer, is evaluated on dynamic scenes captured by singlehand-held cameras and multi-camera arrays, achieving comparable or superiorrendering performance in terms of quality and speed comparable to recentstate-of-the-art methods, achieving reconstruction in 10 seconds per frame andreal-time rendering.},

  abstract={The problem of inferring object shape from a single 2D image isunderconstrained. Prior knowledge about what objects are plausible can help,but even given such prior knowledge there may still be uncertainty about theshapes of occluded parts of objects. Recently, conditional neural radiancefield (NeRF) models have been developed that can learn to infer good pointestimates of 3D models from single 2D images. The problem of inferringuncertainty estimates for these models has received less attention. In thiswork, we propose probabilistic NeRF (ProbNeRF), a model and inference strategyfor learning probabilistic generative models of 3D objects' shapes andappearances, and for doing posterior inference to recover those properties from2D images. ProbNeRF is trained as a variational autoencoder, but at test timewe use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for inference. Given one or a few 2Dimages of an object (which may be partially occluded), ProbNeRF is able notonly to accurately model the parts it sees, but also to propose realistic anddiverse hypotheses about the parts it does not see. We show that key to thesuccess of ProbNeRF are (i) a deterministic rendering scheme, (ii) anannealed-HMC strategy, (iii) a hypernetwork-based decoder architecture, and(iv) doing inference over a full set of NeRF weights, rather than just alow-dimensional code.},

To improve shape diversity, weuse a discrete latent space which is modelled using a bidirectional transformerconditioned on the interchangeable image-text embedding space induced by CLIP.Moreover, we present a novel variant of classifier-free guidance, which furtherimproves the accuracy-diversity trade-off.

We evaluate our vision-based walking policy over adiverse set of terrains including stairs (up to 19cm high), slippery slopes(inclination of 35 degrees), curbs and tall steps (up to 20cm), and complexdiscrete terrains. We achieve this performance with less than 30 minutes ofreal-world data. Finally, we show that our policy can adapt to shifts in thevisual field with a limited amount of real-world experience.

  abstract={Novel view synthesis of static scenes has achieved remarkable advancements inproducing photo-realistic results. However, key challenges remain for immersiverendering of dynamic scenes. One of the seminal image-based rendering method,the multi-plane image (MPI), produces high novel-view synthesis quality forstatic scenes. But modelling dynamic contents by MPI is not studied. In thispaper, we propose a novel Temporal-MPI representation which is able to encodethe rich 3D and dynamic variation information throughout the entire video ascompact temporal basis and coefficients jointly learned. Time-instance MPI forrendering can be generated efficiently using mini-seconds by linearcombinations of temporal basis and coefficients from Temporal-MPI. Thusnovel-views at arbitrary time-instance will be able to be rendered viaTemporal-MPI in real-time with high visual quality. Our method is trained andevaluated on Nvidia Dynamic Scene Dataset. We show that our proposed Temporal-MPI is much faster and more compact compared with other state-of-the-artdynamic scene modelling methods.},

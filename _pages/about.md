I am a forth year (2019-) Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by [Xiaowei Zhou](http://xzhou.me). My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics. I am particularly excited about 3D human pose estimation and reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and differentiable rendering problems.
